                        <p class="bp">In February 1983, an alleged gang rape at the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house sparked an uproar on campus. A female student said that she was carried upstairs by five or six men and raped. After an investigation, the University revoked ATO’s charter, only to have that ruling challenged in a year-long legal battle. After the courts mandated the University conduct a second investigation, the final punishment for the fraternity was a few months barred from campus — a result that many saw as a mere slap on the wrist. “I’m a little disappointed that the sanctions are not as stringent as I would have liked,” then-President Sheldon Hackney said at the time.</p></div>

                            <br><br>The group’s statement, given anonymously to the DP, stressed the rise of acquaintance rape across campus and said their aim was to “promote dialogue at Penn and to point out that … rape is not acceptable.”</p></div>

Students first tried to hold Take Back the Night in 1989, but were unsuccessful due to hecklers. Throughout the 1990s, the event drew large crowds, but also some controversy — critics said the event excluded and antagonized men.</p></div>

                        <p class="bp">In 1997, a former student sued Penn for allegedly covering up her rape three years earlier. The suit, which was settled out of court, claimed that she was raped in what is now called Harrison College House and that Penn Police did not provide her proper support. She also claimed that the University did not include the rape in the crime statistics it reported to the police and federal government — the 1994 crimes report said there were no rapes on campus that year.
                            <br><br>However, a 1994 article in the Daily Pennsylvanian reported that a rape had occurred on the day the student claimed she was raped, even quoting Penn police officials referencing the incident. A later, unrelated Department of Education investigation faulted the University for not including a rape in its 1994 annual statistics.</p></div>

                        <p class="bp">Former neurosurgery professor Tracy McIntosh was sentenced to three and a half to seven years in prison in February 2008 for the sexual assault of his college roommate’s niece in his University office.
                            <br><br>According to a Daily Pennsylvanian article, McIntosh took the then-23 year old woman out to several bars around campus in September 2002. After she began vomiting, the article said, he took her back to his office in Hayden Hall and had sex with her. She filed a complaint with the University two months later and alerted the police. He was charged with rape in May 2003.
                            <br><br>The victim also filed suit with the University, claiming that McIntosh’s colleagues knew he had a history of using his position to harass women and that the University had hindered the investigation. The suit reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.</p></div>

Twice during that semester, student anti-violence groups hosted “speak-outs” at the Penn Women’s Center to encourage discussion about the incidents. 
                            <br><br>“We really have a tragic opportunity with what’s happening to create some kind of momentum to make this a campus-wide issue that’s taken seriously,” Jason Pollack, then-College senior and president of all-male violence prevention group One in Four, said, according to a DP article about the speak-out.</p></div>

                            <br><p class="pp">In February 1983, an alleged gang rape at the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity house sparked an uproar on campus. A female student said that she was carried upstairs by five or six men and raped. After an investigation, the University revoked ATO’s charter, only to have that ruling challenged in a year-long legal battle. After the courts mandated the University conduct a second investigation, the final punishment for the fraternity was a few months barred from campus — a result that many saw as a mere slap on the wrist. “I’m a little disappointed that the sanctions are not as stringent as I would have liked,” then-President Sheldon Hackney said at the time.</p></div>

                                <br><br>The group’s statement, given anonymously to the DP, stressed the rise of acquaintance rape across campus and said their aim was to “promote dialogue at Penn and to point out that … rape is not acceptable.”</p></div>

                            <br><p class="pp">In 1997, a former student sued Penn for allegedly covering up her rape three years earlier. The suit, which was settled out of court, claimed that she was raped in what is now called Harrison College House and that Penn Police did not provide her proper support. She also claimed that the University did not include the rape in the crime statistics it reported to the police and federal government — the 1994 crimes report said there were no rapes on campus that year.
                                <br><br>However, a 1994 article in the Daily Pennsylvanian reported that a rape had occurred on the day the student claimed she was raped, even quoting Penn police officials referencing the incident. A later, unrelated Department of Education investigation faulted the University for not including a rape in its 1994 annual statistics.</p></div>

                                <br><br>According to a Daily Pennsylvanian article, McIntosh took the then-23 year old woman out to several bars around campus in September 2002. After she began vomiting, the article said, he took her back to his office in Hayden Hall and had sex with her. She filed a complaint with the University two months later and alerted the police. He was charged with rape in May 2003.
                                <br><br>The victim also filed suit with the University, claiming that McIntosh’s colleagues knew he had a history of using his position to harass women and that the University had hindered the investigation. The suit reached a confidential, out-of-court settlement.</p></div>
